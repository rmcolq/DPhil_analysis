# All raw reads (pacbio, nanopore, Illumina) are in this bioproject https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA422511

# Assemblies are in https://figshare.com/articles/Hybrid_Enterobacteriaceae_assemblies_using_PacBio_Illumina_or_ONT_Illumina_sequencing/7649051

# Picking two of the four E. coli at random, the SRA accessions for raw reads are:

# Biosample: SAMN10819847 (CFT073, reference strain)
# PacBio: SRX5299472
# Nanopore: SRX5299443
# Illumina: SRX5287344

# Biosample: SAMN10819802 (RHB11-C04, cattle feces)
# PacBio: SRX5299449
# Nanopore: SRX5299467
# Illumina: SRX5287351

# From the preprint https://doi.org/10.1101/530824
# 350 Comparing de novo assemblies and reference genomes for the two reference strains (CFT073
# 351 and MGH78578) we found that the hybrid assemblies from ONT and PacBio reads were
# 352 more similar to each other (e.g. 18 SNPs and 0 indels for CFT073 and 24 SNPs and 13 indels
# 353 for MGH78578) than to the available reference genome sequences (156-365 SNPs and 47-
# 354 439 indels vs. the references, Table S6), possibly due to: (i) strain evolution in storage and
# 355 sub-culture since the reference strains were sequenced; (ii) errors in the original reference
# 356 sequences; and/or (iii) consistent errors in the hybrid assemblies.

# NB the preprint concludes that the filtered assemblies were worse,  but the downsampled ones were the same.
# There were few differences between Nanopore and PacBio hybrid assemblies, and more between these and the reference assembly in NCBI for CFT073
